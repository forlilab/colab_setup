# colab_setup

This repository originally included a GitHub Actions workflow that enables basic clone tracking. Specifically, it counts the total number of clones on a daily basis and periodically updates a public gist:
[ðŸ‘‰ Clone Tracking Gist](https://gist.github.com/rwxayheee/79875b3c477a50db95f050b687cc488d)

If you have forked this repository, please note: 

**The workflow will not run by default unless you have explicitly set the required repository secrets.**

**No data has been collected from your fork unless you have manually configured it.**

However, if you're using this code for teaching or in an institutional setting, it is recommended to remove the workflow from .github/workflows in your fork to avoid any potential conflict with privacy policies.
